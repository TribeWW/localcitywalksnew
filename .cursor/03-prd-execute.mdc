# Task Execution Protocol

## Core Principles

### 1. Implementation Plan First

- **Requirement**: Always provide an implementation plan before executing or writing any code
- **Action**: Outline the approach, break down the task, and present the plan for approval

### 2. Small Steps with Confirmation

- **Requirement**: Perform tasks in small, manageable steps
- **Process**:
  - Break down complex tasks into clear, manageable steps
  - Explain each step in detail
  - Wait for confirmation before moving to the next step
  - Keep the user in full control of the process
  - Always ask the user if he agrees, before starting to implement the code!!!
  - Always follow the [@.cursorrules.md](.cursorrules.md)

### 3. shadcn UI Preference

- **Requirement**: Use shadcn UI components instead of manual implementations
- **Examples**: Use `dialog.tsx` component instead of manually using Radix Dialog
- **Action**: Prefer shadcn UI components when building interfaces

### 4. One Task at a Time

- **Requirement**: Always move one task at a time. Never execute a full phase of tasks
- **Action**:
  - Focus on completing a single task before moving to the next
  - Do not batch multiple tasks or entire phases together
  - Complete and verify each task individually

### 5. Update Implementation Files

- **Requirement**: Always update the tasks in the corresponding implementation file when a task has been implemented
- **Critical**: Implementation files must be updated during execution, not after
- **Action**:
  - Mark tasks as completed in the implementation file immediately after implementation
  - Keep implementation files synchronized with actual progress
  - Update task status, notes, and any relevant information in real-time

### 6. Investigation Documentation

- **Requirement**: For complex tasks requiring investigation, create investigation documentation
- **Action**:
  - Create a new markdown file about the investigation topic
  - Store investigation files in the `documentation/investigation` folder
  - Reference the investigation file in the corresponding implementation documents
  - Include links or references to investigation files when documenting complex decisions

## Workflow Guidelines

### When Receiving a Task:

1. **Analyze** the requirements thoroughly
2. **Plan** the implementation approach
3. **Present** the plan with clear steps
4. **Wait** for approval before proceeding. You need to have the agreement of me. I am in full control
5. **Execute** one task at a time with confirmations (never a full phase)
6. **Update** the implementation file immediately after completing each task
7. **Document** complex investigations in `documentation/investigation` folder and reference them in implementation files
8. **Use** shadcn UI components for UI development
9. **Keep** the user informed and in control throughout

### Communication Style:

- Be explicit about what you're planning to do
- Ask for confirmation at each step. Do not start to code immediately!
- Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- Provide clear, actionable information
- Maintain transparency in the process
- Try to use as minimal lines of code to implement the solution
- Make sure you document all in the comments.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Plan presented before coding
- [ ] Steps broken down clearly
- [ ] Explicit user confirmation obtained
- [ ] One task executed at a time (not a full phase)
- [ ] Implementation file updated immediately after task completion
- [ ] Investigation files created for complex tasks and referenced in implementation documents
- [ ] shadcn UI components used where applicable
- [ ] User remains in control throughout
- [ ] Clear communication maintained
