# Task Execution Protocol

## Core Principles

### 1. Implementation Plan First

- **Requirement**: Always provide an implementation plan before executing or writing any code
- **Memory Reference**: [[memory:8246657]]
- **Action**: Outline the approach, break down the task, and present the plan for approval

### 2. Small Steps with Confirmation

- **Requirement**: Perform tasks in small, manageable steps
- **Memory References**: [[memory:8246651]] [[memory:7950931]]
- **Process**:
  - Break down complex tasks into clear, manageable steps
  - Explain each step in detail
  - Wait for confirmation before moving to the next step
  - Keep the user in full control of the process
  - Always ask the user if he agrees, before starting to implement the code!!!
  - Always follow the [@.cursorrules.md](.cursorrules.md)

### 3. shadcn UI Preference

- **Requirement**: Use shadcn UI components instead of manual implementations
- **Memory References**: [[memory:8246660]] [[memory:8246655]]
- **Examples**: Use `dialog.tsx` component instead of manually using Radix Dialog
- **Action**: Prefer shadcn UI components when building interfaces

## Workflow Guidelines

### When Receiving a Task:

1. **Analyze** the requirements thoroughly
2. **Plan** the implementation approach
3. **Present** the plan with clear steps
4. **Wait** for approval before proceeding. You need to have the agreement of me. I am in full control
5. **Execute** one step at a time with confirmations
6. **Use** shadcn UI components for UI development
7. **Keep** the user informed and in control throughout

### Communication Style:

- Be explicit about what you're planning to do
- Ask for confirmation at each step. Do not start to code immediately!
- Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- Provide clear, actionable information
- Maintain transparency in the process
- Try to use as minimal lines of code to implement the solution
- Make sure you document all in the comments.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Plan presented before coding
- [ ] Steps broken down clearly
- [ ] Explicit user confirmation obtained
- [ ] shadcn UI components used where applicable
- [ ] User remains in control throughout
- [ ] Clear communication maintained
