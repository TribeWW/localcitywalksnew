#PRD Creation Rules

## Goal: Create comprehensive implementation plans for features

## Reference Architecture

- **Coding Standards**: [`.cursorrules.md`](.cursorrules.md) - General product description, backend and frontend architecture, conduct how to write code
- **Design System**: [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](/documentation/guides/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) - Comprehensive design guidelines, color palette, typography, and component standards
- **API**: [Bokun Configuration](/documentation/guides/BOKUN_CONFIGURATION.md) - Bókun API Integration Details

## Required Components

- **Summary** - Clear goal statement that defines the feature in 1-2 sentences
- **Problem Statement** - What user pain point or business need this addresses
- **User Stories** - Who will use this and what they want to achieve
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, testable conditions for completion
- **Technical Requirements** - Performance, security, and integration needs
- **Dependencies** - What other features/systems this relies on
- **Risks & Assumptions** - Potential blockers and what we're assuming to be true

## Step 1: Core Areas to Explore

- **Investigation** - What unknowns need resolution? Research existing patterns, check similar features, identify technical constraints
- **Expected Behaviour** - Gherkin stories (Given/When/Then) that describe user interactions step-by-step
- **Core Functionality** - Key User Actions: What are the primary user flows and edge cases?
- **Scope/Boundaries** - What this should NOT do: Define clear limits to prevent scope creep
- **File Requirements** - What files need changes? Map out all components, pages, actions, and utilities
- **Data Schema** - Backend schema changes needed? New tables, columns, relationships, or API endpoints
- **Design/UI** - Missing designs or mockups? Identify what UI components need to be created or modified

## Step 2: Implementation Plan Components

- **Goals** - Specific, measurable objectives this feature will achieve
- **Gherkin User Stories** - Complete Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path and edge cases
- **Functional Requirements** - Detailed feature specifications with input/output definitions
- **Non Goals** - Explicitly state what this feature will NOT include (prevents scope creep)
- **Success Metrics** - How will we measure if this feature is successful? (user engagement, performance, etc.)
- **Affected Files** - Complete list of files that need to be created, modified, or deleted

## Production Safety - NO MOCKS ALLOWED

**No Mock data/endpoints/functions/placeholders.**

## Production Pipeline

- **Database Changes** - All schema changes must be properly migrated
- **API Endpoints** - Real endpoints with proper error handling and validation
- **Authentication** - Proper auth checks and user permissions
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Testing** - All features must be testable in production environment
- **Performance** - No performance regressions, proper loading states

## File Discovery Rules

- **Search First** - Use codebase_search to understand existing patterns and similar implementations
- **Verify Locations** - Confirm file paths and directory structure before making changes
- **Read Cursorrules** - Always check [`.cursorrules.md`](.cursorrules.md) for coding standards and architectural decisions
- **Check Dependencies** - Verify all imports and dependencies are available
- **Review Similar Features** - Look at existing components/features for consistency

## Output Requirements

- **Format**: Markdown `.md` with clear headings and bullet points
- **Location**: `documentation/implementation-plans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[type]-desc.md`
- **Audience**: Junior Developer with no context - include all necessary background information
- **Current Date**: Automatically insert current date using Markdown preprocessor or script
  - Example: Use `date` command or language-specific date formatting
  - Format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601 standard)
- **Structure**: Follow the template sections in order, include all required components
- **Clarity**: Use simple language, avoid jargon, provide examples where helpful

## Workflow Integration

**Before Starting Development:**

1. Create PRD document using this template
2. Review with team/stakeholders for approval
3. Do not implement ANY CODE. This will be done in another instruction file.
